The goal of this project is to provide minimal code to allow your Rails application to respond to incoming [AWS Lambda Function Handler in Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/ruby-handler.html) `event` and `context` objects in the Lambda handler. We support Application Load Balancer integration or API Gateway.

```ruby
def handler(event:, context:)
  Lamby.handler $app, event, context
end
```
